    <p>I'm a 20 years old Multiplatform App Developer student at Centre d'Estudis Polit√®cnics in Barcelona, Spain.

        I'm passionate about Windows Desktop app and Android app development. I like creating well organised programs and I make attention to quality. I have experience working in a team environment since I've developed 2 major projects with other people, one of them an app featured in the mNactec National Museum.
        
        I would describe myself as someone who likes getting things done, I always share my viewpoint about any problem or solution and I'm open to hear others opinion. If I'm working in a team, I like being heard, so do I to others. I prefer a team where everybody acts as a leader so each one is pushed to improve themselves, if not, I don't doubt about taking leadership.
        
        
        I'm always willing to learn new stuff, whether it is in software development, technology or any other field. Even though I have some app development knowledge, I'm also starting to dive into the web development field.</p>
